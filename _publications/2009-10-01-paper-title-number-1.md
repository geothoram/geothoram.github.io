title: "Implications of Updated Magnetic Anomalies for the Late Cretaceous Tectonic Evolution of Walvis Ridge"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/
excerpt: 'In the South Atlantic, a reorganization of the Mid‐Atlantic Ridge began before anomaly C34n (83.6 Ma) and ended before anomaly C30n (66.4 Ma), complicating tectonics of Rio Grande Rise and older Walvis Ridge (WR), which formed together at the Mid‐Atlantic Ridge. This reorganization is poorly understood because magnetic anomalies C30n‐C34n are poorly defined near WR. We interpreted these anomalies along western WR to improve knowledge of Rio Grande Rise‐WR tectonic development. Anomaly trends indicate that Valdivia Bank has an E‐W age progression, perpendicular to that predicted by hot spot models. Anomaly spacing and width is irregular and anomalous near WR, implying a series of ridge jumps and possibly a microplate between anomalies C34n and C32n. Eastward ridge jumps transferred microplate lithosphere to the South American plate. This study shows that Late Cretaceous tectonic evolution of the Rio Grande Rise‐WR large igneous provinces was more complex than previously understood.'
